abstract = {Abstract The impacts of fisheries on several charismatic marine fauna have been a subject of global concern. Sea snakes share the same habitats as many commercially important fish species and often end up as fisheries bycatch. Previous studies of bycatch from India have been limited to individual reports of mortality, with little information on the regional community structure of sea snakes. This study was carried out along the Konkan coast, off the central west coast of India, between 2016 and 2018, to determine trends in the bycatch of sea snakes in coastal fisheries. In this study, 922 sea snakes were encountered in 916.57 gillnet haul hours and 449.16 trawlers haul hours of fishing, comprising largely of two species: beaked sea snake (Hydrophis schistosus) and spine-bellied sea snake (Hydrophis curtus) (83.05 and 16.94\% respectively) which was in stark contrast to a similar study conducted in 2002â€“03, which recorded a dominance of H. curtus (84\%) followed by H. schistosus (14\%) in the same region. Both studies, however, indicated higher mortality in H. curtus than in H. schistosus in trawl nets. This study highlights the significant impact of non-selective fishing practices on regional assemblages of other marine organisms such as sea snakes from South Asia, which has been relatively understudied, and the potential consequences for local ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Human disturbance can alter the structure and function of ecological communities. We studied bird and butterfly communities of Tamhini wildlife sanctuary to understand the effects two decades of changing land use and management. We replicated a previous study conducted between 1998 and 2001, sampling 7 line transects every fortnight between April 2016 and April 2017. We analyzed the diversity and structure of functional groups and compared our findings to previous surveys. Species diversity increased for both taxa, however, community composition was significantly different across studies. Changing land may affect multiple trophic levels and alter community assembly and ecosystem function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
